###ThumbV1 CPU
ThumbV1 CPU is a minimalistic 16-bit RISC processor architecture with a three-staged single issue pipeline.
Since it is designed to be as simple as possible, the CPU has only one mode of operation (and no protected modes), and has no architectural restrictions to any behavior whatsoever.

###Pipeline
The ThumbV1 design has a single issue pipeline with three stages: Fetch, Execute and Writeback.

###Registers
ThumbV1 has eight registers in total, five of which (R0 to R4) are general purpose registers.

Though the architecture has no behavioral restrictions, it is EXCEEDINGLY recommended NOT TO USE R6 and R7 for general use, because they are NOT INTENDED as such:
From a software point of view, these registers may have the following purposes:

R6 - Link Pointer
R7 - Program Counter

WARNING: Code still can write any value to any register, and even use other registers for the mentioned purposes. However, it is extremely advised not to write in these registers.
R7 and R6 are by design used as Program Counter and Link Pointer, respectively. R7 points to the instruction being currently executed, and R6 temporarily holds the last R7 value whenever a branch occurs.
